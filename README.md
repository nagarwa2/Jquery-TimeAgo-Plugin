# Jquery-TimeAgo-Plugin
This plugin helps to display time in more user friendly way.

For example, when you login into your GMAIL account at bottom right of page you will see your last login time. It doesn't show the exact datetime string, infact a more user-friendly readable text i.e '10 minutes ago'. 

This pluging also show the 'MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS' date format string in html title tag. Hover over the html tag to see the effect. I had also added the toggle functionality, so that on click of html tag you can switch between timeago plugin modified string and 'MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS' date format string.

To acheive that you can use this plugin. Just create a HTML tag with class '.jq-timeago' displaying datetime string in toUTCString(),toLocaleString() etc format. Call the jquery timeago plugin for that element to see the desired result.

For reference take a look at index.html page.
